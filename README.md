# URI Parser in LISP and Prolog

This project involves the development of a URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) parser using LISP and Prolog. The parser is designed to analyze the structure of URIs and respond differently based on their composition. By leveraging the strengths of both LISP and Prolog, the parser can efficiently handle a variety of URI formats and provide context-specific behavior.


## Features

- Objective: To create a robust URI parser that can interpret and process URIs, dynamically adjusting its behavior based on the URI's components.
- Languages: The parser was implemented in both LISP and Prolog, taking advantage of the pattern matching and symbolic processing capabilities of these languages.
- Functionality: The parser breaks down URIs into their constituent parts, such as the scheme, authority, path, query, and fragment. Depending on these components, the parser performs different actions, such as validation, extraction of specific data, or redirection to appropriate processing routines.
- Applications: The logic of this parser can be used in web applications, data extraction tools, and other systems that require flexible and context-aware URI processing.
